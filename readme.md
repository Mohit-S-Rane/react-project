# My Self Learning React Project

This is a repository for my self-learning React project. In this project, I will be building a simple web application using React and other related technologies.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with React and enhance my skills in building interactive user interfaces. I will be implementing various features and functionalities using React components, state management, routing, and other relevant libraries.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized at initial level as follows:

```
├── public
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── Header.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── pages
│   │   ├── Home.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- The `public` directory contains the static assets and the main `index.html` file.
- The `src` directory is where all the React components, pages, and other related files are located.
- The `components` directory contains reusable components that can be used across different pages.
- The `pages` directory contains individual pages of the application.
- The `App.js` file is the entry point of the application.
- The `index.js` file is responsible for rendering the React application into the DOM.
